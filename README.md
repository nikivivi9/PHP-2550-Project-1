## Project 1: An Exploratory Data Analysis on Environmental Condition and Marathon Performance

### Project Description
This project a collaboration with Dr. Brett Romano Ely and Dr. Matthew Ely from the Department of Health Sciences at Providence College, aims to analyze the impact of environmental conditions on marathon performance, focusing on the interaction between age, gender, and weather-related factors. Using a dataset collected from five major U.S. marathons—Boston, Chicago, New York City, Twin Cities, and Grandma’s over a period of 15-20 years, the study investigates how variables such as Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), solar radiation, relative humidity, wind speed, and air quality influence marathon runners' performance.

The performance outcome is measured as the percentage deviation from the course record (%CR), and the analysis is stratified by age and gender. The project also incorporates a new classification of age groups to better reflect the distribution of marathon participants. Through exploratory data analysis and statistical modeling, the project explores how environmental conditions impact performance differently across age groups and genders, with a particular focus on understanding the sensitivity of younger and older runners to these conditions.
